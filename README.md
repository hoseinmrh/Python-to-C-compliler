# Python-to-C-compliler
Compiling python to c language using python language, lex and yacc
The lex.py is the lexxer part and gives out the tokens it reads from p.txt which is our inital python code/
then it passes the toklist to the yacc.py and it parses and then transaltes it into C language which is written in c.txt
